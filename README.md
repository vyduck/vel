# vel
 
Track how much time you've spent in voice channels and organize it into custom labels such as gaming, productivity, etc.

Vel lets you track how much time you've spent in each voice channel, and lets you create groups of channels. Vel can also send leaderboards (top 10 users and your rank) based on single channel or based on channel categories.

Use /vctime [channel] to know how much time you've spent in a particular channel.
Use /leaderboard <channel> <channel-group> to create leaderboard based on given criteria.

Admins can add/remove admins, change mod-role, create/delete/edit/view channel groups.

Server owner is a permanent admin; the role at the top of the role list at the time the bot joins is the default moderator role.
